# qwint_telegram_bot
to initiate dialog just type пицца
bot only knows russian so don't use any alpha symbols exept these
regex based recognition not implemented yet so partition of words is not allowed
it's an idle bot - it won't creata any actual order and won't send any data to db.(though funcs exists it doesn't work for now)
